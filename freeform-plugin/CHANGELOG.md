## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-20

### Added

**Form builder**
- Form management via Block Kit admin UI: create, edit, delete forms
- 13 field types: `text`, `email` (Pro), `textarea`, `number`, `phone`, `date`, `checkbox`, `checkbox_group`, `radio`, `select`, `multi_select`, `hidden`, `html`
- Per-field validation: `minLength`, `maxLength`, `pattern`/`patternError` for text types; `min`/`max` for number and date
- Row-based layout: up to 4 fields side-by-side per row
- Form handles as stable public references (`<FreeformForm formId="contact" />`)
- AI form builder via Claude Haiku — describe a form, fields are added automatically; understands all field types and validation rules
- Manual field add/remove controls alongside AI builder
- `defaultValue` support on all field types including pre-checked checkboxes, pre-selected options, and pre-filled text
- Success message per form

**Submissions**
- Submission storage with cursor-based pagination (25/page)
- Submission detail view with full field values, AI-generated brief, and visitor page journey
- AI brief on every submission: intent, urgency, key facts, suggested next action
- Visitor journey tracking (pages visited before submitting)
- CSRF protection + honeypot spam field on all forms
- URL-based form prefill via query parameters

**Spam filtering** (Pro)
- AI-powered spam scoring (0–10) on every submission via Claude Haiku
- Global default threshold with per-form overrides
- Scores stored on submissions; nothing auto-rejected
- MCP `archive_spam_submissions` tool for bulk archiving

**Email notifications**
- Global reusable notification templates (Mustache syntax)
- Per-form notification assignments with recipient type: submitter email field or fixed address
- HTML and plain-text template formats
- Spam-scored submissions above threshold skip notifications

**Webhooks**
- Outbound HTTPS POST on every form submission
- HMAC-SHA256 signed (`X-Freeform-Signature: sha256=...`)
- Per-webhook or all-forms scope
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff: 1 min → 5 min → 15 min (3 retries)
- KV delivery log (last 20 per webhook)
- Secret rotation without downtime
- Admin UI: add, pause/resume, delete, view log, rotate secret

**CSV export**
- Signed short-lived download URLs (15 min expiry)
- Per-form exports with one column per field handle
- Multi-form exports with a `data_json` column
- Filterable by date range, spam score, archived status, or explicit submission ID list

**MCP server** (via `emdash-freeform-mcp` companion Worker)
- 25 tools covering forms, submissions, notifications, spam settings, and webhooks
- Bearer token authentication (EmDash PAT)
- Proxy-ready via `SOLSPACE_PROXY_MODE` environment variable

### Technical

- `format: "standard"` — marketplace-compatible, runs in EmDash V8 sandbox
- Block Kit admin UI only (no React, no custom JS in browser)
- Storage: EmDash generic JSON+indexes KV API (5 collections: forms, submissions, templates, notificationAssignments, webhooks)
- Network: `network:request:unrestricted` for Anthropic API + webhook delivery
- `email:send` capability for notification emails
- `cron` hook for webhook retry processing (runs every minute)
- Idempotent demo seed via KV flag (`seed:contact_v1`) — works on both marketplace install and trusted-plugin first-load
